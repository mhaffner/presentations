#+BEGIN_NOTES
- This paper has been published in the Geographical Review
- This is part of my dissertation
- Started collecting Twitter, wanting to study all kinds of "interesting patterns"
- Decided to take a step back and examine the contributors 
#+END_NOTES
* VGI and LBSM
- VGI (Goodchild 2007)
- Biases on platforms (Bartoshek and Kebler 2013; Stephens 2013;
  Mathews et al. 2013; Zickuhr 2013; Greenwood, Perrin, and Duggan 2016)
- Contributors' demographics have implications
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- LBSM in the larger context of VGI
- Males are more active on OSM
- Males are more likely to post geotagged photographs
- Zickuhr finds more contributions by minorities and women
- Pew research studies?
- LBSM is one the principal ways people share locational information online
- Contributors' demographics have implications for analysis
#+END_NOTES
* Research focus
- Demographics, usage patterns, and perceptions
- Questions
  - Are there differences in terms of gender, race, and academic standing?
  - Why do people contribute?
  - What are the implications?
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Demographics, usage patterns, and perceptions of a group with high
  rates of contribution
- Questions
  - Are there differences in terms of gender, race, and academic
    standing in terms of both usage and perception?
#+END_NOTES
* Data
- 46 question survey with 7 sections
  - Demographics
  - Mobile phone and tablet use
  - Social media use
  - Geotagging on social media
  - Instagram use
  - Twitter use
  - LBSM perceptions
- /n/ = 253
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- LBSM perceptions - likert scale perception questions, open-ended
  responses
- 5% response rate
#+END_NOTES
* Methods
- Differences in use: Chi-square tests
- Perception:
  - Likert-scale items: Ordinal logistic regression
  - Open-ended items: Qualitative summaries
* Results

"Geotagging social media posts is a good way to let my friends and my
followers know where I am and what I am up to."

* 
"I feel that geotagging infringes on my privacy."

* Results

* 
Why do you choose to geotag social media posts?
- "Usually it's just to further emphasize the caption."
- "[B]ecause where I am is important to the post."
- "Because where I am is part of the story being told by my post."
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Location as an important part of posts -- whether or not posts are geotagged
#+END_NOTES
* 
Why do you choose to geotag social media posts?
 - "So that I can look back and remember where I was and what I was
   doing at certain times."
 - "To remember where I was at the time of the post."
 - "So I can remember where and what I did in my life."
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Six females (but zero males) mention using geotags as a type of
  locational journal.
#+END_NOTES

[[./images/lbsm-survey/why-geo-wordcloud.png]]
* Implications
- Twitter is reasonably representative
- Most differences are between males and females
- Not all VGI principles apply to LBSM
- Motivating factor: locational journaling
- Users geotag content at places they visit infrequently
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Twitter is reasonably representative of the general population,
  albeit for this subset
- 77% of users either agree or disagree with "I prefer to geotag from
  home (apt., dorm, etc.)
- Limitations
  - Shortage of responses by individual racial groups
  - Lack of an intersectionality dimension
  - In terms of privacy, who are people concerned about sharing their
    location with?
- All of these limitations offer great avenues for future research!
