* VGI and LBSM
- LBSM is the way that people share
- Biases on platforms
- The demographics of contributors has implications for analysis
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Males are more active on OSM
- Males are more likely to post geotagged photographs
- Pew research studies?
#+END_NOTES
* Research focus
- Demographics, usage patterns, and perceptions
- Questions
  - Are there differences in terms of gender, race, and academic standing?
  - What are the implications?
* Data

* What is the significance of this research?
- LBSM can be used
  - In disaster situations
  - To study social movements
  - As a replacement for other data sources
- But is it valid for studying spatial process?
#+BEGIN_NOTES
The tension between its representativeness for and its bias
#+END_NOTES
* Case studies
- Project 1: Non-English Twitter activity in Houston, Texas
- Project 2: Android vs. iOS activity in Atlanta, NYC, and Detroit
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Project 1 goal: to test the relationship between percent white,
  percent foreign born, income, unemployment, etc. on Non-English
  Twitter activity
- Project 2 goal: to evaluate whether or not iOS and Android users
  produce significant spatial patterns and to test the relationship
  between iOS/Android production and income
