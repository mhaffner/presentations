- You **will** be confronted with ethically challenging situations.
- Software, digital data, code, and spatial data present a slew of
  interrelated ethical challenges.
* In the following scenarios, did the person act ethically?

- Claire owns a copyrighted book that she bought on Amazon that also
  comes with a digital .pdf. In the book's opening pages, the
  publisher states that redistributing the .pdf is strictly
  prohibited. She prefers hard copies of books, so she reads the
  physical book in whole. When she's done, she emails the .pdf to a
  friend who reads it, then deletes it. Claire never reads the book
  again after she gives it to her friend.

  proprietary LiDAR dataset for the entire county. Under the terms of
  the license agreement, the data cannot be used outside of her
  office. A friend in Bloomer, also in Chippewa County, asks for a

  purchases a detailed road network database for the entire state.
  Under the terms of the license agreement, the network cannot be used
  outside of his office. A friend at the GIS office in Milwaukee
  County asks for a copy of the database to help improve their 911
  network. Recently, an independent organization determined that three
  deaths could have been prevented last month if response times had
  been better during emergencies. Levi opts not to share the database
  so that he remains in compliance with the license.

- Exxon Mobile heavily relies on Google Earth for targeting potential
  drilling sites in the Indian Ocean. They have a team of engineers
  who use the software from an exploratory approach before conducting
  feasibility tests in person. Cheryl, who works for BP, wants to
  bypass the exploratory steps, so she works out a deal with Google to
  purchase a list of Exxon's recent location searches. As a result, BP
  buys the rights to several of these sites and begins extracting oil
  before Exxon Mobile.

- Julian has taken on a redistricting project with the Eau Claire
  school district. He has created an algorithm that minimizes the
  number of students who have to change schools in the upcoming school
  year. However, the district has requested that he create an
  interactive tool that allows them to reposition the district lines
  as they see fit. Not wanting to lose the project, Julian complies
  with their request.

- You see a runaway trolley moving toward five tied-up (or otherwise
  incapacitated) people lying on the tracks. You are standing next to
  a lever that controls a switch. If you pull the lever, the trolley
  will be redirected onto a side track and the five people on the main
  track will be saved. However, there is a single person lying on the
  side track. You have two options: 
  - Do nothing and allow the trolley to kill the five people on the
    main track. 
  - Pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the side track where it
    will kill one person.
