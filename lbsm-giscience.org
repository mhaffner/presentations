1. Location-based social media behavior and perception: Views of
   university students
2. A (critical) spatial analysis on non-English Twitter activity in
   Houston, Texas
3. How this research fits into ECU, Greenville, and the surrounding region
* Location-based social media behavior and perceptions: Views of university students
* VGI and LBSM
- Volunteered geographic information (VGI; Goodchild 2007)
- Location-based social media (LBSM; see Evans 2015)
- Platform (e.g. Facebook, OpenStreetMap) biases (Bartoshek and Kebler
  2013; Stephens 2013; Mathews et al. 2013; Zickuhr 2013; Greenwood,
  Perrin, and Duggan 2016)
- Contributors' demographics have implications
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- LBSM in the larger context of VGI
- Males are more active on OSM
- Males are more likely to post geotagged photographs
- Zickuhr finds more contributions by minorities and women
- Pew research studies?
- LBSM is one the principal ways people share locational information online
- Contributors' demographics have implications for analysis
#+END_NOTES
* Research focus
- Demographics, usage patterns, and perceptions
- Questions
  - Are there differences in terms of gender, race, and academic standing?
  - Why do people contribute?
  - What are the implications?
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Demographics, usage patterns, and perceptions of a group with high
  rates of contribution
- Questions
  - Are there differences in terms of gender, race, and academic
    standing in terms of both usage and perception?
#+END_NOTES
* Data
- Survey administered to 5000 random Oklahoma State students 
- 46 questions with 7 sections
  - Demographics
  - Mobile phone and tablet use
  - Social media use
  - Geotagging on social media
  - Instagram use
  - Twitter use
  - LBSM perceptions
- /n/ = 253
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- LBSM perceptions - likert scale perception questions, open-ended
  responses
- 5% response rate
- Geotagging is the act of posting content on a social media site and
  including geographical information about your current location. This
  can be completed manually (for example, by "checking in" to a
  location or writing where you are) or with the assistance of a
  device's global positioning system (GPS) (for example, allowing your
  device to automatically include your location on your post). Content
  can be precise (a latitude-longituge point) or general (e.g.
  Stillwater, OK or "Eskimo Joe's").

"Geotagging social media posts is a good way to let my friends and my
followers know where I am and what I am up to."

* "Locational journaling"
Why do you choose to geotag social media posts?
 - "So that I can look back and remember where I was and what I was
   doing at certain times."
 - "To remember where I was at the time of the post."
 - "So I can remember where and what I did in my life."
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Six females (but zero males) mention using geotags as a type of
  locational journal.
#+END_NOTES
*** The importance of place
Why do you choose to geotag social media posts?
- "Usually it's just to further emphasize the caption."
- "[B]ecause where I am is important to the post."
- "Because where I am is part of the story being told by my post."
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Location as an important part of posts -- whether or not posts are geotagged

* Implications
- Twitter is reasonably representative
- Most differences are between males and females
- Not all VGI principles apply to LBSM
- Motivating factor: locational journaling
- Users geotag content at places they visit infrequently
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Twitter is reasonably representative of the general population,
  albeit for this subset
- 77% of users either agree or disagree with "I prefer to geotag from
  home (apt., dorm, etc.)
- Limitations
  - Shortage of responses by individual racial groups
  - Lack of an intersectionality dimension
  - In terms of privacy, who are people concerned about sharing their
    location with?
- All of these limitations offer great avenues for future research!
