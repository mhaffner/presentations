#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Feel free to follow along at the link on your own device
- I can go into more detail about literature, specific variables, infrastructure
  and software, etc. I've dedicated the appendix for these items.
#+END_NOTES
* Introduction
- Many studies have investigated VGI's /accuracy/
- Few discuss its /validity/
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- When someone volunteers a location on OSM...
- Treating LBSM as a subset of VGI
- There should be a difference in how we treat LBSM and VGI
- Sources here?
#+END_NOTES
* How these articles tie together
- Article 1 : Users' demographics, behaviors, and perceptions
- Article 2 : Twitter activity (precise location), county scale
- Article 3 : Twitter activity (any location type), metropolitan scale
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Articles 2 and 3 will have similar methodologies but cover different
  topics/geographic scales
- Article 1: investigates practices of the heaviest users
#+END_NOTES
* How these articles tie together

[[./figures/figure1.png]]
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- The interpretations from article 1 will inform those in articles 2 and 3
#+END_NOTES
* Article 1 (survey)
- Goal: to determine LBSM users' demographics and perceptions
- Target population: Oklahoma State University students
- Data: web-based survey taken by 253 students
* Article 1 (survey)
- Methods:
  - Statistical tests for differences between groups
  - Qualitative summaries of common responses
- Geographic themes: gender, race, place
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Differences between groups in terms of
  - Social media use
  - LBSM use
  - Perception (LBSM being a good way to socialize, privacy concerns)
  - Estimating degree of concern based on users' characteristics
  - Qualitative summaries of open-ended responses 
#+END_NOTES
* Article 2 (non-English tweets)
- Goal: determine LBSM alignment with conventional data
- Study area: Harris County, Texas
- Data: all precisely-located tweets from users declaring a language other than
  English in their Twitter profile in Harris County from 10/20/15 - 11/26/16
* Article 2 (non-English tweets)
- Methods:
  - Regression (OLS, spatial lag, spatial error, GWR)
  - Ad hoc observation
- Geographic themes: urban geography, language, race/ethnicity
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Counting the number of non-English tweets (technically users) within each
  census tract
- Ad hoc observation: specific languages used (e.g. MEDINC had a + impact on
  NETU but - in other areas; which languages are being used in these locations?)
- Mobility of users
#+END_NOTES
* Article 3 (BlackLivesMatter tweets)
- Goal: determine LBSM alignment with conventional data
- Study area: metropolitan areas/municipalities areas in Texas and Louisiana 
- Data: all geo-located tweets in Texas and Louisiana containing the text
  "BlackLivesMatter" and/or "AllLivesMatter" from 10/20/15 - 11/26/16
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Why Texas and Louisiana?
  - Originally I wanted to compare BLM/ALM along with tweets about AltonSterling
    and BlueLivesMatter, but this was just too much (5500+ words)
  - Demographically, cities in these two states will work great nonetheless
  - Not to mention that Texas (especially Houston) has a disproportionately
    large amount of Twitter activity 
#+END_NOTES
* Article 3 (BlackLivesMatter tweets)
- Methods:
  - Regression (OLS, spatial lag, spatial error, GWR)
  - Ad hoc observation
- Geographic themes: urban geography, race
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Comparison of profile references to text references (support vs. attention)
- Analysis of individuals (those in Cove, TX), what they are actually discussing

* Conclusion 
- These articles will focus on VGI/LBSM
  - Differentiating between LBSM and other VGI forms 
  - Using profile information, general location
  - Investigating multiple geographic scales
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- I want to highlight what makes this research unique
  - Especially profile information, general location
- How does this fit in geography?
  - Gender
  - Race/ethnicity
  - Language
  - Urban geography
